# Baseball_Classification
This classification problem was given to me from an MLB orginazation for a job I applied for.
I was given a csv file with 5000 pitches, 4000 had pitch classifications and 1000 did not.
I had to build a program that would classify the 1000 pitches missing classifications.
My first attempt, I did not know Machine Learning but still made a program.
I was turned down for the job for because I did not use Machine Learning.
Soon after, I learned Machine Learning and revisited the project, which is attempt 2.
